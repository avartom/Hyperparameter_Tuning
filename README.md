# Hyperparameter Tuning

Gridsearch Hyperparameters

In this project, we learn how to use sklearn's GridsearchCV and keras-tuner libraries to tune the hyperparameters of a neural network model. For the module project we'll continue using these two libraries, however we are going to make things a little more interesting for you.

We continue to use TensorFlow Keras & a sample of the Quickdraw dataset to build a sketch classification model. The dataset has been sampled to only 10 classes and 10000 observations per class.
